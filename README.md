## About
If you have a disability that prevents you from walking around campus, getting around can be difficult. This is an **Android** app that helps users of Cornell's CULift to schedule, edit, and find their school ride to get around campus. 
 
The **iOS user** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-ios). The **Driver App** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-driver). The **Dispatcher and Backend Code** branch can be found [here](https://github.com/cornell-dti/carriage-web).
